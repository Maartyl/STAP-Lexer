program didn't fail on random data, just printed nosense 
and sometimes even static text was displayed wrong

but:

after about 12 milion chars processed about 30MB of memory was used
which was slowly, yet steadily growing

which would suggest a memory leak

though with normal length input shouldn't even be noticable
 - for complexity of solving this bug ad very little gain:
 - very small priority
